# recommendation_engine
This project develops a content-based search algorithm that recommends restaurants with similar geolocations and categories to the user. A Java serlet/web container was created with Tomcat. The data was fetched from Yelp using its Rest API. NoSQL database MongoDB was used to store the data from Yelp as well as the favorite items and browsing history by the user. The front end features an interactive web page by AJAX. The precision of recommendation was improved by ordering restaurants based on distance, stars and matched categories.
